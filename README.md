## Introduction

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age. 

## The Dataset

I downloaded the data from the web and uploaded it into an excel workbook. The data had 3 different sets of data namely: Confirmed, Recovered and deaths. I used power query to transform and merge the 3 documents for analysis. The merged document had 11 columns and 330327 rows. This data covers the period between January 2020 and March 2023.
Data visualization and analysis was done on excel using pivot tables and charts.

In this project I'll analyze the impact of Covid19 in different countries focusing on the confirmed, recovered and death totals. The data columns have the following data:
1. Province/ State
2. Country / Region
3. Latitude
4. Longitude
5. Date
6. Confirmed cases
7. Death cases
8. Recovered cases
9. Year
10. Month
11. Day
